# Infinite Craft bot
This is a bot to play the game [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/). The game starts with the four elements: Water, Fire, Wind, and Earth. You can then start combining elements to create items. For example, Earth and Water make a Plant. The game quickly starts creating many new items. For example, you can combine two Plants to create a Tree, then combine Tree and Fire to create Ash. 

My personal favorite item is Kim-Jong Boom.
